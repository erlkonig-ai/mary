//! Convert a model pile's leaves from `{data|data_f16, shape}` to typed tensors.
//!
//! Pile to pile, into a NEW file. The source is only ever read.
//!
//! # Substitution, not reconstruction
//!
//! The converter does not rebuild the model graph. It COPIES the pile and
//! substitutes one representation for another:
//!
//!   - every fact is carried over verbatim except the three being replaced
//!     (`data`, `data_f16`, `shape`);
//!   - each leaf keeps its OWN entity id and gains one typed leaf fact;
//!   - every blob is copied except the superseded data and shape blobs.
//!
//! Substitution applies ONLY to the leaves actually converted. Everything else
//! — including leaves in encodings this tool has no path for, such as the q4/q8
//! quantized ones — passes through whole, `shape` included.
//!
//! This matters more than it sounds. A converter that rebuilds only what it
//! understands silently drops what it does not — and these piles carry more
//! than weights. `nomic_text` holds a 30,000-piece tokenizer graph hanging off
//! its own root; the rebuild-the-members version of this tool would have
//! reported a confident "112 leaves converted" and produced a pile with no
//! tokenizer in it. Copy-and-substitute cannot lose data it has no schema for,
//! which is exactly the property worth having when the pile knows things the
//! tool does not.
//!
//! Preserving ids also means nothing dangles and nothing downstream has to be
//! told a new address: module edges, model roots, `member` lists and tokenizer
//! references all still resolve. The weights are bit-identical, so the model an
//! id names is the same model; only how its bytes are framed has changed.
//!
//! It does mean a converted pile and a FRESH import of the same checkpoint hold
//! different ids for the same weights, because a leaf id is the content address
//! of its facts and the two forms are different facts. That is content
//! addressing behaving correctly rather than a defect, and preservation is the
//! right side to take: an id already written down in another pile, a commit, or
//! a note has to keep resolving, whereas an id nobody has yet is free. Two
//! piles converge again once both are on the typed form and reimported.
//!
//! # The COLLECTION is the source, and the destination
//!
//! Read and write both go through the signed model collection, not the
//! deprecated branch pins, because the two do not agree and the collection is
//! the one the production voice selects from.
//!
//! Reading the branch is wrong twice over. `qwen3tts.pile` carries TWO pins
//! both named `main` — `lookup_branch("main")` picks whichever it reaches
//! first, and the one it picks holds 1292 of the model's 1465 weight entities.
//! A branch-based conversion of that pile silently carries seven eighths of a
//! model and reports success. Its collection, meanwhile, holds all 1465: the
//! pins are fragments of a history, the collection is the model.
//!
//! Writing the branch alone is wrong in the other direction: `mary::speak`
//! resolves weights out of a `mary-model-graph` COLLECTION, so a converted pile
//! with only a branch fails to open with "no signed model collection" no matter
//! how correct its tensors are. The conversion was already right about the
//! bytes before this seam existed; it was one epoch behind the reader it has to
//! feed.
//!
//! A source containing a bundle collection is rejected before the destination
//! is opened, even when it also contains a graph collection. Bundle members
//! are signed one-row tokens that name model archives, not the model facts
//! themselves. Rewriting one truthfully means replacing those archives and
//! publishing new bundle tokens; folding their decoded facts into a graph
//! commit would silently change the source's collection shape instead.
//!
//! ## Collection identity is preserved, deliberately
//!
//! The typed leaves land as a NEW COMMIT into the SAME named collection, under
//! the SAME descriptor the source publishes as. A typed collection is
//! identified by its policy-bearing descriptor, and the
//! conversion moves none of those, so the collection handle the destination
//! commits against is byte-identical to the source's. That is load-bearing:
//! model piles resolve by content address, and a collection identity that
//! moved would stop every already-persisted reference from resolving. The tool
//! asserts it rather than trusting it.
//!
//! The signer is explicit and must be admitted by the source collection's
//! authority. A fresh destination consequently needs the authority's own key;
//! a delegated key is also valid when its exact `ACTION_WRITE` proof has
//! already been installed in the destination. The converter checks this before
//! doing the large rewrite. An ephemeral key would still append a structurally
//! valid COMMIT, but that claim would be inert and the production loader would
//! correctly ignore the converted model.
//!
//! # One spelling, not two
//!
//! Pre-epoch piles state their attributes under literal ids that current
//! declarations no longer name, so every reader here projects the canonical
//! aliases in beside them. That projection is a read-side convenience, and
//! persisting its output would make it a defect: the destination would state
//! `kind` 1465 times AND its historical literal 1465 times. So the fact set is
//! canonicalized before it is written — the historical spelling is dropped
//! wherever its canonical twin is present, and refused (loudly) where it is
//! not. Nothing is lost; every current reader queries the canonical id.
//!
//! # What is verified
//!
//! Byte-identity is established twice, and neither half is assumed: each
//! payload is decoded back out of the blob just built and compared to the
//! source bytes (here), and the handle IS the hash of those bytes, which the
//! store checks on every read. `pile_leaf_verify` then re-checks the finished
//! pile cold, through the code path a real loader uses.
//!
//! The conversion never materialises a tensor — no `view::<[f32]>()`, no `Vec`,
//! no cast. The source blob's bytes go into the tensor payload as they are.
//!
//! Writing goes through `mary::leaf::put_leaf_as`, the same writer every
//! importer uses — so the rank dispatch, the length check and the read-back
//! comparison are shared with the write path rather than restated here, and a
//! converted leaf is byte-for-byte what a fresh import would have written.
//!
