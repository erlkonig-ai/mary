//! Import Inkling's packed experts for a RANGE OF LAYERS into a pile.
//!
//! The probe (`inkling_pile_import`) takes one tensor name and a count. This is
//! the deployment shape: a node imports the layers it holds. Splitting a model
//! across machines is a query — `experts_in_layers` — and this is the writing
//! half of that same idea, so the range is the argument rather than a tensor
//! name the caller has to know.
//!
//! It is also what fits. The full NVFP4 checkpoint is ~552 GB, of which the
//! experts are ~500 GB, so "import everything" is not an option on a single
//! machine and a layer range is not a convenience — it is the unit of work.
//!
//! One layer's experts are plain BF16 rather than NVFP4 (the checkpoint has 64
//! `w13_weight` but 63 `.scale`). That layer is REPORTED and skipped here
//! rather than guessed at: the packed path would read sidecars that do not
//! exist, and inventing them is how a model comes back as plausible noise.
//!
//! It commits PER STACKED MATRIX rather than once at the end, and that is a
//! correctness property rather than a progress bar. The single-commit shape
//! held the whole share in RAM and left the pile file empty until the last
//! expert was encoded — measured at 0 bytes after 71 GiB of experts. For a
//! 144 GiB share that is not a slow start; it is a run that cannot be
//! interrupted.
//!
//! A model-collection commit is appended only after a matrix's blobs, so an
//! interrupted run authorizes only whole matrices. The next run asks the
//! collection what it already holds and skips it. Resuming and re-running are
//! the same code path: a complete re-run writes nothing and leaves the file
//! byte-identical. A run killed mid-append leaves a partial record on the end,
//! which `--repair` truncates — see the block that does it for why that is a
//! flag and not the open path.
