/// Check the things the encoding cannot: that the root is a model at all, that
/// every leaf is exact f32, and that the tensor names and shapes are the ones
/// this architecture contracts for.
///
/// What is NOT here any more is the shape check. A tensor leaf is one
/// `Tensor<F32, RANK>` blob whose header states its dims, and decoding refuses
/// a payload that is not the length those dims imply — so "does this shape
/// describe this data" is settled before a `Leaf` exists, for every reader, not
/// just this one. Comparing a shape blob against a data blob here was the only
/// way to know that under the two-blob form; under this one it would be
/// re-deriving a fact the leaf already carries.
///
/// The element check survives because it is about the leaf, not its shape: an
/// f16 leaf resolves perfectly well and is simply not what an exact embedding
/// root may contain. The rest survives because it is about the GRAPH — which
/// tensors this root reaches, under which names — which no tensor encoding
/// speaks to.
