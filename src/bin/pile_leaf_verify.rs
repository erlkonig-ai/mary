//! Verify a converted pile against its source.
//!
//! `pile_leaf_migrate` checks each payload as it encodes it, which proves the
//! ENCODE step against bytes it already holds. This opens both piles cold and
//! answers the two questions a converter cannot ask itself:
//!
//!   1. is the output LOADABLE — does the typed read path find every tensor,
//!      with the same shape and the same bytes?
//!   2. did anything ELSE get lost — every fact the converter did not replace,
//!      and every blob it did not supersede?
//!
//! (2) is the one worth having. A converter that silently drops what it has no
//! schema for reports success either way; only a comparison of the full fact
//! sets catches a missing tokenizer.
//!
//! Leaves are compared BY ENTITY ID, not by name. The conversion preserves ids,
//! so identity is checkable directly rather than through a naming convention
//! that could itself be wrong.
//!
//! Both sides are read through their complete set of SIGNED COLLECTIONS, which
//! is the seam `mary::speak` selects from — a converted pile that verifies
//! through the deprecated branch pins and cannot be opened by the production
//! loader has passed the wrong exam. It also settles what "every fact" means:
//! `qwen3tts.pile` has two pins both named `main`, so a branch-side comparison
//! is between one fragment of the source and the whole of the destination.
//!
//! And both sides are CANONICALIZED before comparison — projected into the
//! current attribute spellings, then de-duplicated back down to one spelling
//! each. The source states its facts under pre-epoch literal ids and the
//! conversion writes canonical ones; comparing the raw sets would report every
//! surviving fact as both lost and gained. Canonicalizing both is what makes
//! "nothing was lost" a statement about facts rather than about spellings.
