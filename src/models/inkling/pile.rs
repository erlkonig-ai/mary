//! Inkling experts as pile blobs.
//!
//! The checkpoint stores one expert matrix as five separate safetensors entries
//! bound only by a naming convention — `w13_weight`, `.scale`, `.scale2`,
//! `.input_amax`, `.original_shape`. Nothing makes that bundle atomic, and a
//! reader holding only the first has bytes it cannot interpret: the packed
//! shape says 2048 where the tensor is 4096 wide, and the truth lives in a
//! sixth place the reader has to know to consult.
//!
//! A [`Tensor<NVFP4, 2>`] blob is the bundle made atomic. One content-addressed
//! handle carries the codes, the block scales and the global scale together,
//! with the LOGICAL dimensions in its header — so `original_shape` has nothing
//! left to correct.
//!
//! # Why per expert
//!
//! The stacked form is 256 independent expert matrices in one array: data,
//! block scales and `scale2` all slice cleanly on the outermost dimension.
//! Storing them separately is what makes a checkpoint shareable — a node
//! fetches the experts it holds rather than a 12 GiB slab it either has or does
//! not, deduplication works per expert, and a layer split across two machines
//! becomes a partition of blob handles rather than a file format problem.
//!
//! # Payload layout
//!
//! `[codes][block scales][global scale]`, each contiguous, in that order.
//! Lengths are implied by the header's dims and the element format, so nothing
//! records the boundaries: `codes` is `elems / 2`, `scales` is `elems / 16`,
//! and the global scale is the trailing four bytes.

/// the GPU read was ALIASED out of it. Two things break that.
///
/// The first has always been true and was never priced: two of the matrices the
/// loader binds are FUSED in the checkpoint (`mlp.w13_dn.weight` is gate and up
/// interleaved, `shared_w13_weight` likewise) and are split on the host before
/// binding, so their halves are fresh host buffers that no mapping covers and
/// `slice_or_copy` can only COPY. The router's projection is the same story for
/// a different reason: the MMA tiles n by 8 and 258 rows do not divide, so the
/// bf16 arm binds a padded copy. Those copies are a second residency and always
/// were.
///
/// The second is [`super::budget::DenseWeights::DevicePool`], which copies the
/// rest of the plain-BF16 weights too, and buys 179.0 -> 226.8 GB/s achieved
/// and 18.4 -> 20.2 tok/s for it. That arm was measured to hold 4.94 GiB in the
/// pool where the aliased arm holds 1.41, and admission reported the SAME
/// 111.40 GiB estimate for both -- it could not see a 3.53 GiB difference.
///
/// # Why this is a shape and not a coefficient
///
/// Every byte here is `leaf.bytes.len()`, which is the tensor's own dims times
/// its element width. Nothing is fitted and nothing is per-token: this is a
/// RESIDENT set, held from the bind to the end of the run, and it is a
/// different quantity from the 5.301 GB a decode pass READS across the same 143
