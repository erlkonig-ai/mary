//! `fp4quant` — dynamic **NVFP4 activation quantization** as a CubeCL kernel.
//!
//! The weight side of Inkling arrives already quantized and only has to be
//! *decoded* ([`super::nvfp4`]). The activation side does not: `hf_quant_config`
//! asks for `"*input_quantizer": { num_bits: [2,1], block_sizes: {-1: 16,
//! type: "dynamic", scale_bits: [4,3]}, algorithm: "max" }`, i.e. the
//! activations must be quantized **at run time, per forward pass**, into the
//! same NVFP4 shape the weights are already in. That is this module.
//!
//! ## The recipe (one 16-element block along the contiguous axis)
//!
//! ```text
//! amax   = max |x_i|                      over the 16 elements
//! scale  = amax / 6.0                     6.0 = largest E2M1 magnitude
//! byte   = E4M3(scale)                    round-to-nearest-even
//! s      = decode(byte)                   the value actually stored
//! code_i = argmin_c |E2M1[c] - x_i / s|   round-to-nearest
//! ```
//!
//! There is **no second (`scale2`) level** here. The weights have one because
//! they are quantized offline against a whole tensor; a dynamic per-block
//! activation quantizer has only the block, so `scale` must land in E4M3's own
//! range (`2^-9 .. 448`) unaided. `scale` is clamped to 448 before the cast so
//! that overflow behaviour is this kernel's decision and not the conversion
//! instruction's — CubeCL emits `__nv_cvt_float_to_fp8(..., __NV_NOSAT, ...)`,
//! which would otherwise turn an overflowing scale into the E4M3 NaN pattern.
//!
//! ## Tie-breaking, stated rather than left to chance
//!
//! * **The E4M3 scale** rounds to nearest, ties to **even** significand — that
//!   is what `__nv_cvt_float_to_fp8` does, and `fp4quant_gate` reproduces it on
//!   the host by bracketing the 127 non-negative E4M3 patterns.
//! * **The E2M1 code** is chosen by the GB10's own
//!   `cvt.rn.satfinite.e2m1x2.f32`, which rounds to nearest with ties to the
//!   **even code**. That is not the same rule the seven-comparison `>=` ladder
//!   this kernel used to run applied — that one sent an exact tie *away from
//!   zero* — and the two part on four of the seven midpoints (`0.25 -> 0` vs
//!   `1`, `1.25 -> 2` vs `3`, `2.5 -> 4` vs `5`, `5.0 -> 6` vs `7`; on `0.75`,
//!   `1.75` and `3.5` rounding up already *is* the even code). Ties-to-even is
//!   what the hardware, `cuda_fp4.hpp`, and every NVFP4 producer built on them
//!   do, so it is the rule to be identical to. An exact midpoint requires the
//!   quotient `x/s` to land on a dyadic value with ≤3 significant bits, which
//!   is measure-zero for activation-shaped input: over 1,048,576 real elements
//!   zero codes differ between the two rules. On input drawn from a coarse
//!   dyadic grid 2.2% differ, every one by exactly one E2M1 step.
//! * The instruction also **saturates**: `|x/s| > 6` clamps to `±6.0` rather
//!   than overflowing, and NaN saturates to `±6.0` instead of failing every
//!   comparison and falling out as zero.
//! * A negative input that rounds to magnitude zero keeps its sign and becomes
//!   code `0x8` (`-0.0`), not code `0x0` — including a `-0.0` input, which the
//!   old ladder mapped to `0x0` because `-0.0 < 0.0` is false. Both codes
//!   decode to the same number.
//! * An all-zero block emits a zero scale byte and a zero reciprocal, so every
//!   element becomes `±0.0` and its code is `0x0`/`0x8` — no per-element `s > 0`
//!   guard, and no reliance on `0/0` producing a NaN.
//!
//! ## Output layout
//!
//! `codes` is `[rows, k/8]` `u32`: word `w` holds elements `8w..8w+7`, element
//! `i` at bits `4*(i%8)` — lowest index in the **low** nibble, the ordering
//! [`super::nvfp4`] settled against `compressed_tensors`. On a little-endian
//! host that is byte-identical to the checkpoint's packed `e2m1x2` rows, so the
//! same buffer can be bound straight into the NVFP4 tensor-core MMA (see
//! `nvfp4_mma_probe`) without a repack. `scales` is `[rows, k/16]` `e4m3`, one
//! byte per block, in the same row-major order.
//!
//! ## What the GB10 rewrite cost, measured
//!
//! Framing rule: **static** SASS instruction counts for one thread = one
//! 16-element NVFP4 block, `NOP`/`BRA` excluded. The source is the CUDA CubeCL
//! itself generated for `quantize_nvfp4_kernel` (captured by running
//! `minifloat_caps_probe` under `CUBECL_DEBUG_LOG`), assembled with CUDA 13.0
//! V13.0.88 `nvcc --gpu-architecture=sm_121a -lineinfo -cubin`. *Static*, not
//! wall time — nothing here was timed, and the box was shared. "body" is the
//! straight-line kernel through its last `EXIT`; "helper" is the out-of-line
//! correctly-rounded-division routine `ptxas` plants behind an `FCHK`, which
//! costs I-cache but is not executed on the normal path. The two must not be
//! added and quoted as one number.
//!
//! | lane | | body | helper | loads per block |
//! | ---- | -------- | ---: | ---: | --------------- |
//! | f32  | before   |  660 |   87 | 16 × `LDG.E`     |
//! | f32  | **after**|**170**| 132 | 2 × `LDG.E.256`  |
//! | BF16 | before   |  741 |   87 | 16 × `LDG.E.U16` |
//! | BF16 | **after**|**195**| 133 | 2 × `LDG.E.128`  |
//!
//! Three levers, all of them landing in the default path because each is either
//! free or measured bit-identical: the hardware `F2FP` conversion in place of
//! the ladder (−130 `FSETP`, −110 `SEL`), one hoisted reciprocal in place of
//! sixteen correctly-rounded divides (−16 `FCHK`/`CALL` pairs, −11 `MUFU`), and
//! an eight-wide line in place of scalar loads. The helper column grows because
//! `amax / 6` and `1.0 / s` are two differently-shaped divides where the old
//! kernel's seventeen were all the same shape and shared one routine.
//!
//! Behind the `q4` feature, which is what pulls the `cubecl` dependency in
//! (`cuda-backend` enables it). Gated by `fp4quant_gate`.

/// The pair packing is little-endian — the first f32 of a pair lands in the LOW

/// `compressed_tensors`, so the four bytes reinterpret straight to the `u32`.
///
/// ## Why the block is *one* divide and sixteen multiplies
///
/// The obvious spelling, `x_i / s` per element, is what this kernel used to be,
/// and it was the single most expensive thing in it: CUDA's `/` is correctly
/// rounded, so `ptxas` plants an `FCHK` + `CALL` slow-path pair *per element* —
/// seventeen of them counting `amax / 6` — plus eighteen `MUFU`. Hoisting one
/// reciprocal deletes all sixteen element divides in favour of sixteen `FMUL`.
///
/// `amax / 6.0` **stays a real divide**. It runs once per block rather than once
/// per element, so it is a sixteenth of the cost, and it is the one rounding the
/// whole block hangs on: the E4M3 scale byte is a bit-checked output, and
/// `amax * (1/6)` rounds twice and can land on the other side of an E4M3
/// midpoint. Exactness is cheap here and expensive per element, so it is bought
/// where it is cheap. (Measured, `sm_121a`: spending it costs 93 static SASS
/// instructions, all but ~12 of them in a never-executed out-of-line helper.)
///
/// The per-element reciprocal is not free of that concern either — `x * fl(1/s)`
/// rounds twice where `x / s` rounds once, so a quotient within ~1e-7 relative
/// of an E2M1 midpoint can fall the other way. `fp4quant_gate` counts those
/// near-boundary elements explicitly and checks every code bitwise against an
/// f64 host reference, so the claim is measured on real Inkling data rather than
/// assumed.
///
/// ## The block amax has no hardware assist on this chip, and does not need one
///
/// Probed against `ptxas` 13.0.88 rather than the ISA docs, which disagree with
/// it here: `redux.sync.max.f32` is a *die-family* gap, not a suffix gap — it
/// assembles to `CREDUX.MAX.F32` on `sm_100a`/`sm_103a` and is rejected
/// identically on `sm_120a`, `sm_121`, `sm_121a` and `sm_121f`. Nor is there an
/// f16 door around it: `redux` is 32-bit-integer-only on every architecture, and
/// while `red.global.max.noftz.v2.bf16` and
/// `cp.reduce.async.bulk…max.bf16` *do* exist where their f32 forms are
/// rejected, both are element-wise memory reductions, not horizontal ones. Every
/// reduction unit on GB10 is cross-*lane* (`REDUX`, `SHFL`, `ATOM`, `UBLKRED`);
/// none of them reduces a thread's own registers.
///
/// That is not a limitation to work around — it is why this layout is cheap. A
/// `redux` is one instruction for 32 elements; one `FMNMX` here is one
/// instruction for 32 independent *blocks*. Re-laying the kernel out as sixteen
/// threads per block to reach `redux` costs ~10× more warp-instruction slots per
/// block and drops the loads from `LDG.E.256` to `LDG.E.32`.
///
/// So the amax is software, written to cost as little as software can: `FMNMX`
/// takes an `|src|` operand modifier, so `max(|a|, |b|)` is one instruction and
/// the `abs` is free — where the old `if v < 0 { a = -v }` / `if a > amax` pair
/// spent an `FSETP` and a `SEL` each. Sixteen elements, fifteen `FMNMX`, as a
/// tree rather than a chain so the dependency depth is 4 instead of 16.
