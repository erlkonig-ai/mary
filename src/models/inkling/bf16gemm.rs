//! Routed-expert FFN on the native BF16 tensor-core path.
//!
//! Inkling-Small is mixed precision: 41 of its 42 layers carry NVFP4 experts and
//! layer 2 carries plain BF16 ones — `w13_weight` `[256, 4096, 4096]` and
//! `w2_weight` `[256, 4096, 2048]`, 12.9 GiB, with no `.scale` sidecar because
//! nothing quantised them. The authors left an early, sensitive layer
//! unquantised; the runtime's job is to run it AS BF16, not to re-quantise it
//! and not to widen it.
//!
//! This is [`super::fp4gemm::fp4_linear`] minus the block-scale plumbing.
//! Everything structural is the same — one plane per `(m_tile, n_tile)`, the
//! weights streamed once out of global memory, the activation re-read per plane
//! out of L2, the accumulation in the MMA's own f32 accumulator — and the two
//! differences are both consequences of the format:
//!
//! * [`cmma::MmaDefinition::new`] instead of `new_scaled`, because BF16 carries
//!   no scales. Same type, same `execute` protocol, different constructor.
//! * `m16n8k16` instead of `m16n8k64`: the k of one instruction is a property of
//!   the operand width, and 16 bits per element buys a quarter of the k that 4
//!   bits did.
//!
//! ## f32 accumulation is not widening
//!
//! `mma.sync…bf16` has no BF16-accumulator form: the instruction multiplies
//! BF16 by BF16 and accumulates into f32, and f32 is its OWN output type. The
//! weight is never materialised wider than it is stored — the bytes go from the
//! checkpoint's mapping into A/B registers as `bf16`. What the f32 lane this
//! replaces did, and what the standing spec forbids, is something else: it read
//! the stored BF16 and wrote 604 MB of f32 per token to hold weights the
//! checkpoint keeps in 151 MB.
//!
//! ## The activation is BF16 too
//!
//! For the same reason the NVFP4 lane's activation is E2M1: the instruction
//! takes the same type for both operands. Here that costs nothing to justify —
//! the reference implementation runs the whole model in BF16, so a BF16
//! activation is what `transformers` multiplies as well. The cast is
//! [`to_bf16`], on the DEVICE, so its rounding is the hardware's
//! round-to-nearest-even and matches `torch.Tensor.to(torch.bfloat16)` rather
//! than a hand-rolled host twin of it.

// `double tma mma` wins both ends, so it heads the preference list; the rest is
// a FALLBACK CHAIN, not a tuning surface. A strategy declines a shape it cannot
// tile or align, and declining is an answer -- the walk stops at the first one
// that takes the shape and the hand kernel, which takes every shape the forward
// issues, is the floor.
//
// The choice is cached per `(m, k, n)`: a probe costs a failed setup, and the
// forward issues the same handful of shapes tens of thousands of times.

/// The order [`bf16_gemm`] tries lanes in, unless `INK_GEMM` names one.
///
/// The TMA lanes head it, and they are the reason the alignment gate below is
/// not optional. A `cuTensorMap` requires a 16-byte-aligned global address; the
/// first attempt at this list died on "Tensor pointer must be 16 byte aligned"
/// during the layer uploads, because the weights are ALIASED out of the pile
/// mapping at whatever offset the leaf lies at and that seam only promises 4.
/// It is an ASYNC launch fault that poisons the server, so it cannot be caught
/// and retried -- the alignment has to be decided before the launch. With
/// `Bf16W::align` deciding it, a weight the TMA lane would fault on never
/// reaches this list at all, and the lane is safe on both bind arms.
/// It opens with a GEMV, and that is the decode step's whole story: a decode
/// step feeds ONE row, `gemv plane par` is the only routine here that reaches
/// this part's memory roofline on one row (219 GB/s on `attn wq` against 121
/// for the best tiled lane, 252 GB/s on the 134 MB `dense w13` against 120),
/// and it DECLINES the shape as soon as m grows. That decline used to be
/// described here as costing "a prefill pass one failed setup per shape and
/// nothing else", which is true at m = 512 and badly false at m = 2: the lane
/// below the gemv is the PREFILL lane, so a two-row pass fell all the way past
/// the widths in between and paid a fixed ~23 ms a node for it. That is what
/// [`PREFERENCE_NARROW`] is, and this list is now the m = 1 and m >= MTILE list
/// rather than the only one.
///
/// `simple vecmat` is deliberately NOT on the list: it is a hair slower than the
/// gemv at m=1 and it ACCEPTS m=16, where it is four times slower than the tiled
/// lanes -- a lane that takes a shape it should refuse is worse than one that
/// refuses a shape it could take. It is off [`PREFERENCE_NARROW`] for the same
/// reason, measured there.
///
/// It ends with `simple unit`, not the hand kernel. The hand kernel needs m
/// padded to 16 and the tuned lanes do not, so once [`rows_for`] stops padding

// The TIMED lane choice, and the recorded negative it has to answer for.
//
// The walk above caches the first lane that does not ERROR. That is a
// correctness filter wearing a performance filter's name: nothing in it
// measures, so `bf16_gemm`'s own claim to run "on the fastest lane this box has
// for the shape" was true only where the static order happened to be right.
//
// [`PREFERENCE_NARROW`]'s doc records a per-shape auto-tuner that was built and
// measured WORSE end to end, and this one is not a retry of it -- it is built
// around the three things that table says went wrong:
//
//   * It cost 10.2 ms a pass at m = 1, where it abandoned `gemv plane par` for
//     seven of nine shapes. So [`Autotune::Narrow`] -- what `INK_GEMM_AUTOTUNE=1`
//     turns on -- does not tune m = 1 at all. The m = 1 order is the one width
//     [`PREFERENCE`] was actually measured for; there is nothing to find there
//     and a recorded 10.2 ms to lose. `INK_GEMM_AUTOTUNE=all` opens it anyway,
//     for whoever wants to re-measure that claim rather than inherit it.
//   * "In isolation the lanes come out within a percent of each other and the
//     pass says otherwise." So a win under [`AUTOTUNE_MARGIN`] is not a win: the
//     static head is kept unless the timer beats it by more than the isolated
//     timer's own credibility. A tuner that switches lanes on a 1% isolated
//     margin is reporting its noise floor as a decision.
//   * "A GEMM timed alone is a GEMM that had the whole device, and four of a
//     layer's projections are independent and overlap." That one is NOT fixed
//     here and cannot be from inside a single call. It is why this is default
//     OFF and ablatable: the arbiter is `scripts/bench-decode.sh` with an
//     `INK_GEMM_AUTOTUNE=1` arm against a bare one, not this file.
//
// ## The L2 hazard, which `inkling_bf16_gemm_bench` warns about by name
//
// That binary's doc: "Looping one weight buffer makes anything under a few tens
// of MB L2-resident ... so exactly the shapes with the least grid parallelism --
// the ones an access-pattern change is aimed at -- are the ones this harness
// hands a warm cache." This loop has the same shape and therefore the same
// hazard, and it is worse here because the bias is not uniform across lanes: a
// bandwidth-bound lane gains more from a resident weight than a compute-bound
// one, so a warm cache does not merely inflate every candidate, it REORDERS
// them. Three things narrow it and none of them closes it:
//
//   * Round-robin, not all-iters-of-A-then-B. Every candidate is timed once per
//     round, so whatever the cache and the clocks are doing across the tune is
//     common-mode instead of accruing to whoever went first.
//   * The MEDIAN of the rounds, never the minimum. The minimum sample is the
//     most cache-flattered one by construction.
//   * Round 0 is discarded: it is the round that compiles the kernel.
//
// What survives is that every candidate is judged on a weight the previous
// candidate just streamed. In a real pass 4 GiB of other weights cycle through
// between two touches of the same one, and no timer that runs inside one call
// can reproduce that. So the pick is a WARM-CACHE pick, it is labelled as one,
// and it is only evidence once an end-to-end A/B agrees with it.

// ## What it found, and what that is worth
//
// `inkling_gemm_autotune_gate 2,3,4,5,8 --core`, DGX Spark GB10, 2026-08-25.
// Per shape and width: which lane the static walk takes, which lane a timed
// walk takes. Three shapes that dominate a pass, the five verify widths.
//
// FRAMING: per-GEMM ISOLATED timings, microseconds per call, on a looped
// weight, on a box with no other GPU compute but other agents' build load.
// They rank lanes at one shape. They are NOT a throughput claim, and nothing
// below says a pass gets faster.
//
//     run   rotation  iters  disagreeing pairs   spread of the deltas
//       1   no            2      12 of 15            10% .. 66%
//       2   no            2      15 of 15            12% .. 67%

//
// Runs 1 and 2 said the static head is wrong everywhere by a wide margin. Runs
// 4 and 5 are the same code as each other and say something much weaker. The
// difference between the two pairs is not the GEMMs, it is TWO INSTRUMENT
// BIASES that runs 1 and 2 contained:
//
//   * Fixed position. The head of the list was always the first candidate
//     timed in a round, and this part idles at 208 MHz and ramps to 2411 --
//     first-in-round is a seat, not a coincidence. Rotating removed it.
//   * A sync divided by two. The timed region ends in a sync whose cost is
//     charged to whatever it closes; over two iterations that overhead sits
//     inside the 45-350 us these GEMMs take. Over eight it does not.
//
// Neither bias was visible in runs 1 and 2. Both produced a large, consistent,
// entirely quotable effect. That is the whole reason this file now carries a
// plausibility guard, a margin, and a doc paragraph instead of a lane swap.
//
// ## Run 4 against run 5: the same code, twice
//
// The honest reading is the INTERSECTION, because 4 and 5 are replicates:
//
//     shape            m   run 4 pick               run 5 pick
//     attn wq          5   ordered double mma       double hybrid mma
//     attn wq          8   double hybrid mma        double tma mma spec
//     shared gate+up   8   double hybrid mma        specialized cyclic cmma
//     shared down      4   double hybrid mma        specialized cyclic cmma
//     shared down      5   ordered double mma       specialized cyclic cmma
//     shared down      8   specialized cyclic cmma  specialized cyclic cmma
//
// Six of fifteen pairs disagree with the static order in BOTH runs. In ONE of
// those six do the two runs name the same replacement. So:
//
//   * That the static head is not the timed winner at some verify widths
//     reproduces -- `shared down` at m = 4, 5, 8 and `attn wq` at m = 5, 8.
//   * WHICH lane should replace it does not reproduce at all. The challengers
//     are within a few percent of each other and of the run-to-run noise,
//     which is precisely what `PREFERENCE_NARROW`'s doc recorded about the
//     previous tuner: "in isolation the lanes come out within a percent of
//     each other and the pass says otherwise".
//   * The margins that survive are 4% to 14%, against 10% to 67% before the
//     instrument was fixed. An effect that shrinks fivefold when you correct
//     the timer is mostly timer.
//
// So a CHANGED row means "the isolated timer disagrees with the order here",
// not "the order is wrong here". `PREFERENCE_NARROW`'s end-to-end table
// measured the `pk4` head BEST at w = 2, 3 and 5 (101.0 / 102.0 / 116.3 ms
// against 109.2 / 115.8 / 125.8 for the list as written), and a lane that
// loses alone and wins in a pass is exactly what that doc predicted: "a GEMM
// timed alone is a GEMM that had the whole device, and four of a layer's

/// * `QuantStore::PackedU32(1)` — the argument is a REVERSE dim index, so 1 is
///   the `k` axis of the logical `[k, n]`, and it also *decides* the matrix
///   layout (0 row-major, 1 column-major) rather than the strides deciding it.
/// * `QuantLevel::block([16, 1])` — `[block_row, block_col]` over `[k, n]`. A
///   one-element `block([16])` unsqueezes at the FRONT and means "16 along n",
///   which is the wrong axis and fails silently.
/// * `data` carries the PACKED shape and strides in `u32` words; `scale` the
///   BLOCK shape and strides in E4M3 elements. No fractional stride is needed
///   because the layout divides the logical coordinate by the packing factor
///   before multiplying by the stride.
/// * `MatmulElems` still names `rhs: bf16` — that is the DEQUANTISED type, and
///   it is what makes the stage and the MMA BF16.
///
/// The nibble order matches: `e2m1x2`'s low nibble is the lowest index, which

///
/// So the honest reading of "163 GB/s BF16 against 74 GB/s four-bit" is not

///
/// Kept, not deleted, because "the tuned path is closed and here is the
