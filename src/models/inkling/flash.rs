//! Global attention that never builds `[heads, n, n]` — online softmax, one pass.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! Thirty-five of Inkling-Small's forty-two attention layers are local, and
//! [`super::banded`] fuses them. The other **seven are global**, and until this
//! file they went through burn's generic matmul with a MATERIALISED softmax
//! over the whole key axis: `q @ k^T` into a `[heads, rows, tokens]` block, a
//! scale/bias/mask epilogue over that block, `softmax(scores, 2)` over it
//! again, then `p @ v`. The block is bounded only by `INK_QBLOCK`, which
//! bounds `rows` and nothing else, so the key axis is the sequence and the
//! whole thing is linear in `tokens` per query row with a large constant.
//!
//! ## Why the seven matter more than the thirty-five
//!
//! Not at the context we benchmark. At ~3.7k attention is 7.6 ms of a 54 ms
//! decode step and fusing it buys almost nothing; this file is not for that
//! number and should not be tuned against it.
//!
//! It is for the two regimes where the global layers are the constraint:
//!
//! * **Decode at long context.** A global layer reads the whole cache:
//!   `8 kv_heads * 128 * 2 (K and V) * 2 B` is 4 KiB per token per global
//!   layer, so at 1M tokens the seven of them move **28 GB per decode step** in
//!   BF16 against 5.77 GB of weights — attention becomes ~5x the entire rest of
//!   the model. NVFP4 KV (unconditional now) takes that to ~8.1 GB. The
//!   crossover where global-layer KV traffic equals weight traffic is ~400k
//!   tokens. A fused pass does not reduce the KV read — nothing can, the keys
//!   must be looked at — but it removes everything ELSE the old lane moved: the
//!   `[heads, 1, slots]` score row written by the matmul, read and rewritten by
//!   the epilogue, read twice and written once by the softmax, and read again
//!   by `p @ v`. At 1M that row is 128 MB and it is touched six times.
//! * **Prefill.** The global layers cannot materialise `[n, n]` at long `n` at
//!   all, and the old lane's peak working set was never just the score block:
//!   it GQA-expands K and V to `[heads, tokens, head_dim]` first, which is two
//!   819 MB buffers at 100k tokens in BF16, linear in the sequence, with no
//!   knob on them. This kernel indexes `h / groups` instead, so the expansion
//!   does not happen, and the relative-bias table is the only thing left that
//!   scales with the query block.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! One cube per `(query tile, KV head, key split)`, 128 units — four planes of
//! thirty-two. A cube holds `ROWS` query rows, and those rows are a
//! `(head, query)` RECTANGLE: `groups` query heads (all the heads that share
//! this KV head) by `ROWS / groups` consecutive queries. That is the whole GQA
//! saving expressed as a tile shape — K and V are read once for all `groups`
//! heads that need them, rather than once per head off an expanded copy.
//!
//! Within a cube, plane `w` owns rows `[w * rpp, (w+1) * rpp)` and lane `l`
//! owns key `l` of the current key tile and output dimensions
//! `l, l+32, l+64, l+96`. So:
//!
//! * a row's thirty-two scores live in ONE plane, and the online softmax's row
//!   max and row sum are `plane_max` / `plane_sum` — no shared-memory tree, no
//!   `sync_cube` per reduction. (`plane_max` lowers to a shuffle loop on this
//!   backend, not to `redux.sync.max.f32`, which sm_121a does not have.)
//! * the output accumulator is `rpp * head_dim / 32` REGISTERS per lane — 32 at
//!   the prefill tile, 4 at the decode tile — and never touches memory until
//!   the cube ends.
//!
//! Nothing quadratic is written down. The largest thing this file allocates is
//! the partial-output buffer, which is `splits * nq * heads * head_dim`.
//!
//! # Online softmax is the one part that is not ordinary GEMM practice
//!
//! Tiling a product over `k` is what every GEMM does. What flash attention
//! genuinely invented is running the softmax's normalisation as a RUNNING
//! quantity: each cube carries `m` (the max seen so far) and `l` (the sum of
//! `exp(s - m)` so far) per row, and when a tile pushes the max up it rescales
//! the accumulator by `exp(m_old - m_new)` before adding the new tile's
//! contribution. The answer is the same as a two-pass softmax to the last bit
//! of the accumulation order, and the key axis is never materialised.
//!
//! `NEG_INF` here is a large FINITE constant, the way the rest of this module
//! tree spells it, and that forces every guard to be explicit: `-3.4e38 -
//! -3.4e38` is `0`, so `exp(s - m)` for a fully-masked tile would be `1` rather
//! than `0` if it were left to the arithmetic. Both the rescale and the
//! exponential are branch-guarded instead of relying on infinity's algebra.
//!
//! # Staging K, and not staging V
//!
//! The score phase has lane `l` walking all `head_dim` dimensions of key
//! `t + l`. In the `[tokens, kv_heads * head_dim]` layout both the projections
//! and the paged cache produce, that is thirty-two addresses `kv_heads *
//! head_dim` floats apart — thirty-two memory transactions per warp
//! instruction, which is the failure [`super::banded`] measured at 187 ms of a
//! 190 ms kernel and fixed by transposing K to `[kv_heads, head_dim, tokens]`.
//!
//! A transpose is not available here. The decode lane reads PAGES of a cache
//! that is stored token-major and quantised token-major, and transposing them
//! per layer per step would cost a full read and a full write of the very
//! bytes the fusion exists to stop moving. So this kernel STAGES instead: the
//! key tile is copied into shared memory by all 128 units in coalesced
//! `head_dim`-wide lines, and the score phase reads it from there, where the
//! access pattern costs nothing. That is the same class of fix a sibling
//! measured as ~2x on the 4-bit weight GEMMs (`fp4_linear_smem`), and it is why
//! a flash-shaped kernel wants no transposed input: it stages by construction.
//!
//! The shared tile is padded to `head_dim + 1` floats a row. Without the pad,
//! lane `l` reading `sk[l * 128 + d]` puts all thirty-two lanes on bank
//! `d % 32` — a thirty-two-way conflict on every single shared read of the
//! inner loop. With it, lane `l` lands on bank `(l + d) % 32`, which is
//! conflict-free.
//!
//! V is NOT staged, for [`super::banded`]'s reason: in the value phase lane `l`
//! owns output DIMENSIONS at a fixed key, so `[tokens, kv_heads * head_dim]`
//! already has consecutive lanes on consecutive addresses. The four planes read
//! the same V line, which L1 serves.
//!
//! # Splitting the key axis, and why decode needs it
//!
//! At decode `nq` is 1, so the grid without a split is `1 x kv_heads x 1` —
//! eight cubes, on a device with dozens of SMs, each walking a million keys
//! serially. That is not a kernel, it is a queue. So the key axis is SPLIT:
//! split `s` runs the same online softmax over its own slice and writes an
//! UNNORMALISED `(o, m, l)` triple, and [`flash_combine_kernel`] merges them
//! with the same rescale the tile loop uses — `exp(m_s - M)` weighting, one
//! division at the end. This is flash-decoding, and it is what turns eight
//! cubes into as many as the device will take.
//!
//! The combine also runs when there is one split, where it is a normalisation
//! pass. That costs one extra read and write of `nq * heads * head_dim` f32 —
//! nothing next to the key axis at the lengths this file is for, and one code
//! path instead of two.
//!
//! # What it measured
//!
//! **Framing rule for every number in this section.** Milliseconds for ONE
//! attention layer at the 42-layer release's global shape (hidden 4096, 32
//! heads over 8 KV heads, `head_dim` 128, `d_rel` 16, `rel_extent` 1024), on a
//! GB10, with the projections and the two short convolutions INCLUDED — these
//! time `attention_prefill` and `attention_step`, not the kernel alone. The
//! model has SEVEN global layers, so multiply by seven for a step's global
//! attention. Both arms of each pair are the same binary in the same working
//! directory, switched by `INK_FLASH`, because cubecl's autotune cache lives at
//! `$CWD/target/autotune` and a cross-worktree comparison measures the cache.
//! `reserved` is what the cubecl pool holds afterwards — a high-water mark
//! within a process, so a row inherits every row above it.
//! [`super::burn::flash_prefill_cost_at_length`] and
//! `flash_decode_cost_at_context` are the two benchmarks; both are `#[ignore]`d.
//!
//! DECODE, one step, NVFP4 KV:
//!
//! ```text
//!   context   window     fused    dense
//!      4 096        -      1.17     1.58   1.35x
//!     16 384        -      2.60     4.01   1.54x
//!     65 536        -      7.76    29.94   3.86x
//!    262 144        -     28.79   120.17   4.17x
//!     16 384      512      0.76     1.01   1.33x
//! ```
//!
//! The last row is a LOCAL layer — the window trims the cache to its last 512
//! keys, so it measures a 512-key read whatever the context says — and it is
//! there because [`super::burn::attention_step`] does not check `kind`: all
//! forty-two layers take this kernel at decode, not just the seven.
//!
//! PREFILL, whole sequence:
//!
//! ```text
//!    tokens     fused    dense      fused MiB   dense MiB
//!     1 024      14.4     15.3           2542        2542
//!     4 096      90.2    159.6           3021       10199
//!     8 192     283.3    583.1           3051       40824
//!    16 384    1206.5   2210.7           3051       40824
//!    32 768    5515.2   8728.5          11186       41303
//! ```
//!
//! So it pays everywhere, and the answer to "at what N does it start to pay"
//! is "at the shortest length either benchmark runs" — which is not what I
//! expected to find, and the reason is that the arm it replaces was never
//! compute-bound. Its cost is the `[heads, rows, tokens]` score block written
//! by the matmul and walked five more times, plus a GQA expansion of K and V
//! that is linear in the sequence with no knob on it. The memory column is the
//! sharper result: 3.0 GiB at 16k tokens against 40.8, and the fused figure is
//! flat from 4k to 16k where the dense one is not.
//!
//! ## What it does NOT reach, and why, and what would
//!
//! 5.5 s for one layer at 32,768 tokens is 8.8 TFLOP of arithmetic in 5.5 s,
//! i.e. **1.6 TFLOP/s** — under 1% of what this part's tensor cores can do.
//! That is not a mystery and it is not headroom that tuning recovers. One key
//! tile costs `2 * PLANE * head_dim * 4` bytes of K and V and buys
//! `ROWS * PLANE * head_dim * 2` flops, so the kernel's arithmetic intensity is
//! `ROWS / 4` flops a byte — 8 at [`ROWS_PREFILL`] — and 8 flops a byte against
//! this box's ~273 GB/s is a **2.2 TFLOP/s ceiling**. The measurement is at 73%
//! of it. The kernel is at its intensity limit, not at its instruction limit.
//!
//! Two things raise that ceiling and neither is a tuning knob:
//!
//! * **More rows per cube.** Intensity is `ROWS / 4` and nothing else. 64 rows
//!   would double it; what stops it is the 48 KiB a static `__shared__` gets,
//!   since the query tile alone would be 32 KiB at f32. Holding the query tile
//!   in BF16 — which the arm this replaces already does for its matmul — fits
//!   64 rows in 40.5 KiB. That is a change to the kernel's operand precision
//!   and wants its own pairing against `golden/paired/`.
//! * **MMA.** At prefill `m` is large and `mma.sync.aligned.m16n8k16` is what
//!   the score product should be running on; [`super::bf16gemm`] already uses
//!   it in this tree. At DECODE it buys nothing — `m` is 1, the product is a
//!   GEMV, and the decode numbers above are bandwidth-bound already.
//!
//! # Burn already has a flash kernel, and it was rejected on evidence
//!
//! `cubek-attention` 0.2.0 is in our `Cargo.lock` and already compiled into
//! every mary build — one feature word away from `cubek::attention::launch::
//! launch_ref`. It is not used here, and the reasons are three properties of
//! its interface rather than a preference:
//!
//! * **The relative-position bias is not expressible.** Its mask is a BOOLEAN
//!   predicate — `MaterializedTileMask::should_mask() -> bool`, with a `u8`/
//!   `u32` mask dtype — not an addend. (`MaskTile`'s "additive mask" doc
//!   comment is stale.) And our own pinned burn fork closes the door
//!   independently: `burn-cubecl/src/ops/module.rs:325-330` routes to
//!   `attention_fallback` the moment `attn_bias`, `softcap` or `scale` is
//!   present, and the fallback materialises `[b, h, n, n]` — which is the exact
//!   thing this file exists to stop. Inkling's every layer carries a learned
//!   per-head bias gathered by backward distance; there is no arm of this model
//!   without one.
//! * **A paged, NVFP4 KV cache cannot be handed to it.** K and V must be
//!   strided float tensors read through `AttentionGlobalLayout`; the crate
//!   contains no `paged`, `fp4` or `quant`. Using it means materialising one
//!   contiguous BF16 cache per layer per step — the copy `KvStore::parts` was
//!   changed to stop making.
//! * **GQA 32/8 is silently wrong rather than refused.** `AttentionDims` takes
//!   ONE `num_heads`, from `query.shape[1]`; `key.shape[1]` is never read and
//!   nothing validates the pair.
//!
//! Structurally it also has no split over the key axis — its hypercube is
//! `(seq_q_tile, batch * num_heads)` — so at decode it is thirty-two cubes each
//! walking the whole cache serially, which is the shape this file's splits
//! exist to fix. 0.3.0-pre.3 keeps all four and adds a training backward pass,
//! at the cost of rebasing our cubecl fork off 0.10. Upstream is aware: cubek
//! #284 ("Paged flash attention support") has been open since 2026-05-19 and
//! #310 migrates the kernel to the Tile DSL. This is the same answer
//! [`super::banded`] reached for the thirty-five local layers, for the same
//! kind of reason.
//!
//! One thing upstream has that is worth borrowing later: 0.3's
//! `AttentionGlobalLayout::new` takes separate batch and head strides with
//! explicit broadcast, which makes 32/8 GQA expressible as a strided VIEW — Q
//! as `[8, 4, sq, d]` against K/V as `[8, 1, n, d]` with the head axis
//! broadcast. That is the same correspondence this kernel spells as a cube tile
//! (`groups` heads by `rows / groups` queries), and it is the tidier
//! formulation of the two.
//!
//! # Reading NVFP4 in registers, and why it is OFF
//!
//! `INK_FLASH_FP4=1` swaps the fetch for the packed one: the kernel reads the
//! stored E2M1 codes and E4M3 block scales and decodes in registers, and no
//! dequantised page is built at all. It is one comptime branch at two fetch
//! sites; everything below them is the same code. The old note here said this
//! would "save the page-sized round trip through L2" and called it a change to
//! the READER, not to this kernel's shape. The second half was right. The
//! first half was wrong about L2, and the difference is the whole result.
//!
//! ## The round trip is to DRAM, not through L2
//!
//! **Framing rule for this section.** Per DECODE STEP of `INK_LAYERS=0:21` at
//! ctx 3732, `INK_KV=1`, NVFP4 KV, one GB10, median of six warm steps (spread
//! under 0.5%). Bytes are `lts__d_sectors_fill_sysmem.sum * 32 B`, which is the
//! DRAM read on this part: GB10 exposes **no `dram__` metric at all** —
//! `ncu --query-metrics` lists none — and `lts__d_sectors_fill_device.sum` is
//! structurally zero because the memory is unified, so there is no separate
//! device aperture to fill from. Anything asking this part for
//! `dram__bytes_read.sum` gets an error, not a number.
//! (`lts__t_sectors_op_read_lookup_miss` is NOT the counter to use either: it
//! reads 3% miss on the dequant's packed input, which cannot possibly be
//! resident.)
//!
//! | kernel | launches | DRAM read | L2 read | DRAM/L2 |
//! | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
//! | `dequantize_nvfp4` | 84 | 26.5 MiB | 25.7 MiB | 1.03 |
//! | `flash_kernel` (dense) | 42 | 82.9 MiB | 83.8 MiB | **0.99** |
//! | `flash_kernel` (packed) | 42 | 26.3 MiB | 34.0 MiB | 0.77 |
//!
//! **99% of what the dense arm reads back comes from memory.** The pages the
//! dequant wrote microseconds earlier, into a 24 MiB L2, are not there any
//! more. That also settles the write half without assuming anything: flash read
//! those bytes from DRAM, so the lines had been evicted, and evicting a dirty
//! line IS the write-back. Both directions are real traffic, and the headroom
//! is therefore BOTH halves rather than only the one L2 residency could reach.
//!
//! The whole KV path, per 21-layer step: 26.5 MiB of codes read, 94.2 MiB of
//! BF16 written (the read times the kernel's exact 3.556x expansion — there is
//! no DRAM-write counter on this part, and flash's 82.9 MiB read-back is a
//! floor under it), 82.9 MiB read back. **203.6 MiB, against 26.3 for the
//! packed arm: 177 MiB a step removed at 21 layers, ~355 at 42.**
//!
//! One counter needs its own warning. `lts__t_sectors_op_write.sum` on the
//! dequant reads 1393 MiB a step, 16.8x its actual output, because it counts
//! sector REQUESTS and the kernel does sixteen separate 2-byte stores per
//! thread at a 32-byte stride — every store instruction touches 32 sectors for
//! two bytes each. It is not bandwidth (`write_lookup_miss` is ~0, so L2's byte
//! enables absorb it) but it is LSU instructions, and multiplying that counter
//! by 32 gives a number 16.8x too large.
//!
//! ## And at ctx 3732 it is 1.8% SLOWER
//!
//! Paired, ABBA-balanced arm order inside one interleaved run, n = 7, same
//! binary, ctx 3732, `INK_LAYERS=0:21`, `INK_GEN=40`, one GB10: **+1.80% on
//! step time, 95% CI +1.43..+2.17**, against A/A controls of -0.29% and
//! +0.06%. 44.9 ms/step against 45.7. An earlier build that decoded through the
//! `e2m1_value` comparison ladder rather than
//! [`super::fp4quant::e2m1_bits`] read +1.83% (CI +1.73..+1.93) — the same
//! number, which is itself the finding below.
//!
//! The reason is in this file's own doc, four sections up. Split by grid, the
//! 42 flash launches of one warm step at ctx 3732 are:
//!
//! | layers | grid | cubes | DRAM read |
//! | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
//! | 3 global | `(1, 8, 29)` | 232 | 44.0 MiB |
//! | 18 local | `(1, 8, 4)` | 32 | 36.1 MiB |
//! | 21 tail pages | `(1, 8, 1)` | 8 | 2.9 MiB |
//!
//! **Nearly half the traffic moves in grids of 32 and 8 cubes on a 48-SM part**,
//! at `sm__warps_active` 8.3% of peak. "That is not a kernel, it is a queue":
//! it is LATENCY-bound, not bandwidth-bound, so bytes removed from it are bytes
//! it was not waiting on, while the per-element decode lands straight on the
//! critical path.
//!
//! **And the cost is not arithmetic**, which is measured rather than argued:
//! replacing the seven-comparison ladder with the branchless bit construction
//! roughly halved the decode's operation count and gave back every register it
//! had cost (47 -> 39, one BELOW the dense arm), and moved the step time by
//! nothing at all — 1.83% to 1.80%, each well inside the other's interval.
//!
//! What that leaves, and this part is inference rather than measurement, is the
//! LOADS: the packed reader issues two an element (a code word and a scale
//! byte) where the dense one issues one, in a loop each of the four planes runs
//! redundantly — `vv` depends only on `(j, di, lane)`, so all four decode the
//! same element. Anyone testing that should put
//! `l1tex__t_requests_pipe_lsu_mem_global_op_ld.sum` on both arms; it was not
//! in the session that produced the numbers above.
//!
//! ## The crossover is real, and it is where the argument said it would be
//!
//! At ctx 14928 with `INK_LAYERS=0:8` — where the model still fits one box and
//! one global layer carries 58.2 MiB of the step's 58.6 — the same paired ABBA
//! design at n = 7 reads **-1.15% on step time, the packed arm FASTER**, 95% CI
//! -1.65..-0.64, every one of the seven reps negative, against A/A controls of
//! -0.06% and -0.38%. The grid there is `(1, 8, 116)` — **928 cubes**, a full
//! device rather than a queue — and the sign flips because the kernel is
//! finally waiting on the bytes this change removes.
//!
//! Read that beside what `bench-decode` prints for the same run, which is
//! "+0.93% tok/s, SMALLER THAN THE SPREAD. Not a result." Both are correct and
//! they are not the same statistic: the script compares each arm's median
//! against the other's, and at long context the per-arm spread is 2-4%. The
//! PAIRED difference inside each rep is what resolves 1%, which is why the
//! arms are interleaved in the first place. An unpaired reading of this run
//! would have concluded nothing.
//!
//! So it is a switch that is OFF, and what it is waiting for is named rather
//! than guessed: a value loop that does not decode V four times and does not
//! issue a load an element. Giving a lane a CONTIGUOUS run of dimensions would
//! do both — one 32-bit code word would serve eight elements and one scale byte
//! sixteen — but that is a change to the lane-to-dimension mapping, i.e. to
//! this kernel's SHAPE, which is exactly what the old note said the packed read
//! would not need. The note was right that the reader change is local. It was
//! wrong that the reader change is sufficient.
//!
//! It is DECODE-only in effect: the prefill global arm reads freshly projected
//! K and V rather than the cache, so it never reaches this flag — which is just
//! as well, since a packed reader would turn prefill's one dequant an element
//! into one per query tile.
//!
//! ## What it costs in registers, and what it does not spill
//!
//! `flash_kernel` at the decode tile is **39 registers a thread against the
//! dense arm's 40**, and `launch__occupancy_limit_registers` is 12 blocks an SM
//! on both. Neither binds: `launch__occupancy_limit_shared_mem` is 5 on both.
//! Local memory is **0 bytes loaded and 0 stored on both arms**, so nothing
//! spilled — worth having measured rather than inferred, because this is the
//! kernel where a spill would be silent.
//!
//! ## What it removes regardless of the clock
//!
//! 84 dequant launches and 84 per-step allocations a step at 21 layers (168 at
//! 42), sized by [`super::kvpages::Pages::read_rows`] and therefore re-sized
//! whenever the read window grows. The flash partials `po` and `pml` remain and
//! are still sized from the span, so this does not by itself make the decode
//! path allocation-free — but it removes the buffer the KV-preallocation work
//! named as the remaining per-step epoch.
//!
//! It also has no MMA path. At decode `m = 1` and tensor cores buy nothing —
//! the product is a GEMV and the kernel is bandwidth-bound. At prefill `m` is
//! large and they would; see the measurements in the commit for where that
//! leaves the prefill lane against burn's cmma matmul.
