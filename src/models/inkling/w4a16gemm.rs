//! W4A16: an NVFP4 **weight** against a BF16 **activation**.
//!
//! [`super::fp4gemm::fp4_linear`] runs the hardware block-scaled MMA
//! (`kind::mxf4nvf4`), and that instruction takes E2M1 for BOTH operands — so
//! it quantises the activation too. For the ROUTED experts that is not a
//! liberty: the checkpoint's `hf_quant_config.json` sets `"*input_quantizer"
//! … enable: true`, i.e. the publisher calibrated for a 4-bit activation and
//! W4A4 is what they meant.
//!
//! For everything else in the model they did not. The sink experts, the
//! attention projections and the unembedding carry no `.scale` sidecar and no
//! `input_amax`; the publisher left them BF16 and never calibrated an
//! activation quantiser for them. Quantising their activations is a numerics
//! decision nobody made.
//!
//! But the *reason* to want four bits there is untouched by that. Decode is
//! bound on the DRAM read, not on the MMA: `lm_head` alone is
//! `[201024, 4096]` BF16 = 1.65 GB, read once per step and once per draft
//! depth. The bandwidth win of FP4 lives entirely in that read. So this lane
//! takes the half of NVFP4 that is free — the stored bytes — and declines the
//! half that costs calibration.
//!
//! ## Where the dequantisation happens
//!
//! In registers, during the B-fragment load, and nowhere else. Decoding the
//! weight into a scratch buffer first and multiplying that would spend exactly
//! the bandwidth this exists to save (and then some: the scratch is written as
//! well as read). Each lane reads the packed `u32` word holding its own two
//! codes plus the one E4M3 scale covering them, expands them to BF16 in two
//! registers, and hands those straight to
//! [`cmma::MmaDefinition::execute`]. The weight is never wider than four bits
//! anywhere outside a register file.
//!
//! Structurally this is [`super::bf16gemm::bf16_linear`]: same `m16n8k16`
//! instruction, same one-plane-per-`(m_tile, n_tile)` grid, same
//! `position_of_nth` fragment addressing, same f32 accumulator. The only edit
//! is what sits between the global load and `reg_b`.
//!
//! ## Two facts that make the pair-at-a-time decode exact
//!
//! * `vector_size(B)` is 2 for BF16 and `position_of_nth` returns an EVEN `k`
//!   for the first of each pair, so a lane's two elements are `k` and `k + 1`
//!   with `k` even — one packed byte, low nibble first ([`super::nvfp4`]
//!   settled that ordering against `compressed_tensors`).
//! * A 16-element scale block starts at a multiple of 16, so an even-aligned
//!   pair never straddles one. Both elements share a scale.
//!
//! The loads below are written per-element anyway, indexing `(gc + j)` rather
//! than assuming `gc`. On the layout above both `j` resolve to the same word
//! and the same scale byte, so it is one DRAM line either way and the kernel
//! does not silently depend on a fragment layout it cannot check.
